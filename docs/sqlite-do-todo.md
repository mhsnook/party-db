# Finishing the RDBMS, SQLite, Durable Object story

We have completed version 0, and are now working toward version 1 (the first
version I actually want to use in an actual app).

Version 0 was enough to make these example apps work, and to connect the
Tanstack DB collections over a PartyServer on a Durable Object. The DB collection
is the entire API surface for all reads and writes, and the server handles
them transparently with zero code and zero config. That was a good POC.

Next, v1 is meant to work in the same Durable Object/PartyKit environment, but
on a DO that has its own SQLite database that holds the authority on the data,
provides the canonical order for the stream, and enables complete backfill/
catchup -- in other words, it's the first version I actually want to use in a
project!

The major structural outcome here is the completion of this write-confirm-settle
cycle where a couple things are true:

- Tanstack DB collection operations on clients are the entire API
- User performance about as good as the laws of physics currently allow
- DX that handles all server logic, mutations, and realtime connection with less
config than a `queryCollection`: no `queryFns`, no `onUpdate`

v2+ (Postgres-WAL, RPCs, RLS, slicing, (Supabase?)) is **parked**
(bottom); see architecture → Roadmap.

**Where we actually are:** the transport/sync plumbing is built and solid — wire
format, channel multiplexing, `seq`, optimistic → ack → settlement, delta
reconnect, fan-out (this *is* v0). What's *not* built is the v1 persistence model:
the code still does the schema-agnostic `(k, data)` blob upsert. So the work is
making the data real, and making the package testable.

| 4 | Shared wire types + apply contract; per-target apply code | ✅ | client applies via `applyBatch` (`src/client/apply.ts`); server via `applyOne`/SQL |
| 5 | **Persist into structured tables reflecting your schema** | ❌ | code ships the *uncontrolled* blob fallback (`onStart`/`applyOne`: `(k,data)` upsert). **Structured tables = the core work below.** |

## The list

> Practical ordering: do **item 2 (tooling)** first so you can build item 1 with
> tests. But item 1 is the *point* — it's what "finish the SQLite story" means.

### 1. Structured relational tables — **P0**

- [ ] **Use the same client DB schema on the server.** Zod schemas are already used
      on the client to validate inserts and updated in to the Tanstack Collections.
      On the server they are just a very quick validator. Projects come with their
      own database and types, and Zod schemas that could power their Tanstack
      Collections, and we're able to extrapolate the rest. `TableDef` carries
      `{name, key, schema}`.
- [ ] **CRUD against typed columns** in `applyOne` (insert/update/delete into real
      columns), replacing the blob upsert.
- [ ] **The database is the authority.** A write is a genuine transactional commit
      the DB's constraints can reject; rejection fails the POST (client optimistic
      rollback), success *is* the acceptance. The server applies the batch in the
      order given, in one transaction — it does **not** re-derive write-ordering;
      the DB judges. Zod may run server-side as a cheap *error-sooner* gate, never
      as the correctness authority.
- [ ] **Injection-safe by construction.** Bind every *value* with `?` (the current
      code already does this for keys/data/etc.). Take every *identifier* — table
      and column names — from the schema/config allowlist, validated against
      `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`, **never** from the client payload's keys (build
      column lists from the Zod schema, not `Object.keys(row)`). Tiny surface — a
      handful of statements.
- [ ] **Resolved-row reconciliation (mandatory).** The committed row can differ
      from the sent row (defaults, generated columns, serials, trigger effects).
      Return the resolved row (`WriteAck.changed` + on the stream) and have the
      client swap its optimistic overlay for it. This is the piece the blob model
      existed to avoid; it is required now (and completes §7).
- [ ] **Serial / db-assigned PKs.** Falls out of resolved rows — support it instead
      of forbidding it. (Client-minted UUIDs stay the easy default.)
- [ ] **Constraint-error reporting.** Surface a DB rejection cleanly to the
      mutating client (which constraint, which row), not a bare 500 — the app can't
      be made to change how it constrains data, so we report its verdict faithfully.

### 2. Project tooling & tests — **P0** (nothing exists; the foundation)

You currently cannot typecheck or test the package in isolation.

- [ ] **Installable dev deps / workspace** so `pnpm typecheck` passes on a clean
      checkout. Today it fails — deps unresolved at root, plus two real
      implicit-`any`s: `collection.ts:63` (`sink`) and `party-db-server.ts:75` (`r`).
- [ ] **Test runner** (vitest).
- [ ] **Unit tests:** `applyBatch` (`src/client/apply.ts`); `SyncClient` routing /
      `pending` buffer / `waitForSeq` / high-water mark; `persist` grouping
      (`toEvent`, by-channel split); `partyTransport` `since`/`lastSeq` tracking.
- [ ] **Server tests:** structured `applyOne` (insert/update/delete + constraint
      rejection + resolved row) + oplog seq; `onRequest` multi-batch atomic commit +
      broadcast order == seq order; `snapshot` vs `replaySince`; unknown-channel → 400.
      Write these against the **structured** path as it lands — don't entrench the
      blob placeholder.
- [ ] **Integration test** (workers/miniflare pool): round-trip insert → ack →
      settle → a second client sees the resolved row; reconnect delta replays the gap.
- [ ] **CI** running typecheck + tests on the branch.

### 3. Oplog lifecycle — **P1** (`_oplog` grows forever today)

- [ ] **Retention/compaction** of `_oplog` (tunable by rows/age). Nothing trims it now.
- [ ] **`since`-floor fallback:** if a client's `since` is older than the oldest
      retained seq, send a **fresh snapshot** instead of a gappy delta.
      `replaySince` has no floor check, so post-compaction it would silently drop rows.
- [ ] Lock the snapshot/seq consistency that single-threaded sync gives us with a
      test (so a future refactor that adds an `await` mid-snapshot can't break it).

### 4. Robustness / input validation — **P1**

- [ ] Validate `since` is a non-negative integer; else snapshot (`Number(since)` →
      `NaN` on garbage today, `onConnect`).
- [ ] Validate the POST body is actually `WriteBatch[]` before iterating — malformed
      body currently throws → 500 (`onRequest`).
- [ ] **Settlement can hang forever.** `persist` awaits `waitForSeq`, which only
      resolves when the seq streams back; if it never does (writer's channel not
      registered, or a persistent disconnect) the mutation promise hangs. Bound it
      (timeout → reject/retry) — note §7 deliberately waits on the *stream* not the
      bare ack, so don't "fix" this by resolving on ack (reintroduces flicker);
      reconnect's `?since` is the real re-delivery path.

### 5. Auth — **P1** (none today)

- [ ] Auth hook on **socket open** (`onConnect`) and **POST** (`onRequest`):
      bearer/session, reject unauthorized, pluggable so the room owner supplies the
      check. Today any client can read the whole room and write to it.

### 6. Cross-collection transaction visibility — **decided: ordered on receive**

- [x] **Ordered, not atomic, on the receiving side — no group id, no extra fields.**
      A cross-collection write commits atomically on the server, and the *writer*
      settles on all its seqs; subscribers just receive the constituent writes in
      `seq` order and apply them as they arrive (fine for a feed/chat — a reader
      seeing the post and then its tag, in order, is fine). README overclaim
      corrected.

### 7. DX / packaging polish — **P2**

- [ ] Build story: `exports` point at `.ts` source — fine for a source/monorepo
      consumer, but a published package needs a build step. Decide, or document
      "source-only for now."
- [ ] `package.json` `description` still says "MOCK / PROPOSAL … not wired into
      scenetest-cloud" — update it.
- [ ] Example nit: `todos.toArray as Todo[]` is used as a value — confirm it's the
      getter, not a missing call.
